# Sparta Core Project 1
## Snake Game

We all are very well familiarised with this game.

Snake Game used to be our delight on the 3310 Nokia's phone.

This looks a bit more modern, but the logic remains the same.

__Have Fun!__

### Task

To build a **browser based game!**

Your game should be built using html, css and JavaScript!

The game must:
* Include an instruction section explaining how to play the game.
* Ether display a message when the user has won or display the users score after the game has finished.
* Be styled to perfection!
* Be hosted online!
* You could include some fancy animations in your game...
* You could into HTML5 Audio and include some snazzy sound effects...

##### Most Pleased With
- Design (clean and user friendly)
- Different screens in one page
- Logic and development game process
- Attention to details (music on/off, favicon)

##### Most Challenging Part
- Building the javascript Logic
- Synchronise the snake with the keyboard keys
- Collisions with the wall
- Working with canvas (couldn't improve the design of it)
